# HomeAutomationAndroid

NodeMCU / Arduino - ESP8266 Code at : https://github.com/AnmolMajithia/HomeAutomation

### Current Functionality :
- 4 button layout
- Works flawlessly with arduino code at above mentioned git repo
- Sends hardcoded byte values to esp8266 or any reciever if IP and Port are entered in settings menu
- Simple color change of button to display current state (on or off)


### Future Ideas to Add :
- [ ] User defined values to send to reciever for button ON and OFF (in bytes or UTF based on option)
- [ ] User defined icon adding to buttons
- [ ] Themes
- [ ] Multiroom multiprofile options (different IPs or Ports or both) which would change the opening screen to room/profile selector
